# CTA Ridership Data Analysis Project  

This Tableau project analyzes **Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) ridership trends (2015-2024)** using data from [Data.gov](https://data.gov/)  
CTA Dataset: [CTA Ridership Daily Boarding Totals](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/cta-ridership-daily-boarding-totals)  

The project includes multiple visualizations to explore trends over time (2015-2024), including **two dashboards and two heatmaps**. The design incorporates **CTAâ€™s official logo colors** to enhance visual consistency.

## ðŸ“ˆ **Key Learnings & Insights**  

### ðŸ“‰ **Impact of COVID-19 on CTA Ridership**  
- The **2020-2021 period shows a significant drop** in ridership due to the pandemic, with all charts reflecting a steep decline.  
- **Bus and rail boardings fell sharply**, especially during lockdown months.  
- **Monthly and quarterly trends reveal that ridership post-COVID remains below pre-pandemic levels**, but is gradually increasing.  

### ðŸ“Š **Post-Pandemic Trends**  
- **Quarterly performance remains below the historical average**, though there is **a slow upward trend** in ridership recovery.  
- Weekday ridership has rebounded **faster than weekend ridership**, possibly due to commuters returning to work.  

### ðŸŽ¨ **Color Matching with CTA Logo**  
- The dashboard design follows **CTAâ€™s official color scheme** to maintain brand alignment.  
- Heatmaps use **gradient intensity** to represent variations in ridership levels effectively.
